# Psychic-game

In this repo you will find JavaScript, CSS and Basic HTML which creates a basic Psychic Guessing Game.
The JavaScript allows the user to make a guess using any keyboard letter press; this will then be checked against a randomized computer selection. If you guess correctly, you win. If you guess incorrectly 10 times, you lose. Good luck!!
